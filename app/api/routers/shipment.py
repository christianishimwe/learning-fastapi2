    Notice how we used Depends to inject the database session into our endpoint, this allows us to use the session to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the shipments table.
    insted if we just used session = get_session(), this would be given a value at function defintion time, but
    we won't be able to get the cleanups, yields will not work well since the function will no longer be a generator, and we won't be able to use the context manager to manage the database connection, this is why we use Depends to inject the session into our endpoint, this allows us to use the session as a dependency and get the benefits of the context manager and yields.
